Turbo Debugger - 

Installation Notes

This program will run directly off the CD, but to save or modify
any information it must be copied to your Hard Drive.

Make a directory on your Hard Drive and then copy the contents of
the d:\borland\tdebug\ directory to the directory you just made...

Example:

d:\borland\tdebug>copy *.* c:\tdebug [press enter]

Now run TD.EXE from your hard drive...

Thats it!
